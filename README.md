# Agile_1
I downloaded and installed PyCharm Professional and then created a Hello World command-line app.
Once I built the app, I modified arguments directly in the command line. I also experimented with adjusting the argument in the program, before finalizing on 1 argument. Finally, I run the program with 1 argument (my name) in the command line.
